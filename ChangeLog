== Change Log ==

NOTE: Changes after December 2011 are tracked in the jslogo version control change history.

2011-12-29
	Added support for IE8 via FlashCanvas
	Migrated unit tests over to use QUnit.

2011-10-22
	Added another feature from Ofer Wald: ARC angle radius (example)

2011-10-14
	Added COPYDEF and made it and ERASE respect REDEFP when it comes to primitives (built-in procedures).
	Applied two patches from Ofer Wald: make text drawn with LABEL (example) rotate with the mouse, and prevent primitives from being overridden with TO
	You can now put short programs in the URL hash (#blah) as well as the query string (?blah).

2010-08-07
	Modified the way the turtle is drawn - it now uses an overlay canvas instead of drawing to a backbuffer. This simplifies the code. (I didn't realize HTML5 canvases were transparent when I first implemented this!)
	Removed fallback canvas text API support, so LABEL will not work on iOS 3 and earlier or Firefox 3.0.

2010-03-27
	Added: WINDOW, WRAP, FENCE and TURTLEMODE

2009-11-26
	Infix arithmetic and order-comparison operators now force arguments to be numbers.
	Fractional decimals with no leading zero (e.g. .1) now parse correctly again.
	Added: PENPAINT, PENERASE, PENREVERSE
	READWORD can take an optional prompt string input. e.g. (READWORD "width:)

2009-11-24
	Expression evaluation separated from parsing. AND and OR now short-circuit evaluation.
	Slight tweaks to TYPE output.
	Added aliases: BF, BFS, BL, IFT, IFF, OP
	Added: READWORD, ABS

2009-11-19
	You can now specify a program to run in the URL hash or query string. You can %-encode characters or, as a shortcut, use _ instead of space, e.g. http://www.calormen.com/Logo/?repeat_4_[fd_100_rt_90]
	Thanks to discussion on LogoForum has shown me the error of my ways regarding lists. The contents of list literals is no longer evaluated.

2009-11-11
	UCBLogo alignment - almost done!
	Added: run, runresult, test, iftrue, iffalse, .maybeoutput, ignore, for, do.while, while, do.until, until

2009-11-10
	UCBLogo alignment continues....
	Added: contents, procedures, primitives, globals, names, erase, erall, apply, invoke, foreach, find
	Also, fixed a bug with word on WebKit, and ensured that long text output wraps.

2009-11-09
	UCBLogo alignment continies....
	Added: name, local, localmake, thing, global, procedurep, primitivep, definedp, namep, forever, bye
	Corrected stop - was like bye, now like an empty output

2009-11-08
	UCBLogo alignment continies....
	Added: remainder, modulo, exp, log10, ln, radarctan, radsin, radcos, radtan, rseq, bitand, bitor, bitxor, bitnot, ashift, lshift, label, setlabelheight, shownp, labelsize, pendownp, pencolor, pensize
	Removed: modulus (use remainder or modulo), write (use label), setfont (use setlabelheight)
	Corrected argument order for (arctan x y)
	In (setpencolor r g b), r/g/b must be in 0..99; Logo colors 0...15 are supported.

2009-11-07
	I've started to work on aligning the syntax with UCB Logo. Language reference now follows UCB Logo documentation structure for ease of comparison. Code and unit tests similarly reorganized.
	Added: sentence, combine, gensym, firsts, butfirsts, item, remove, remdup, wordp, listp, numberp, count, ascii, char, lowercase, uppercase
	Added aliases setpensize, setpencolor
	Fixed equality comparisons
	Added: push, pop, queue, dequeue, emptyp, beforep, memberp, substringp
	Rigged up a text screen overlay.
	Added: print, type, show, cleartext, emptyp, beforep, memberp, substringp
	Use write for turtle graphics text now

2009-10-31
	A series of appropriately spooky changes - they're there, but you can't see them!
	Change log is now accessible as an Atom feed
	Switch to native Javascript types for primitive types (number, string, list)
	Cleaned up use of 'undefined', stopping
	Turtle graphics puled into own script module
	Pulled alerting on error out of interpreter
	Unit tests for unary minus, true, false
	Unary minus handling revamped - now confined to parser/serializer

2009-10-28
	def now takes a string argument for procname
	def now serializes operators correctly
	Fixed clean (was alerting)
	Fixed heading (was returning incorrect values)
	More unit tests

2009-10-27
	Found and fixed a handful of bugs while implementing unit tests:
	Operators <=, >=, <> were incorrectly parsed
	if, ifelse and repeat return now result of last evaluation (language extension?)
	and, or, xor now return 0 or 1
	lessequalp and lessequal? corrected

2009-10-26
	Fixed hiding of the language reference pane
	Corrected documentation - it's setfont not font
	Added text rendering for non-Mozilla browsers c/o Jim Studt's Hershey Font implementation for HTML5 canvas

2009-10-24
	Now licensed under the Apache 2.0 license

2009-04-13
	Fixed towards and setpos, which have been broken since the 2008-08-30 update (Sigh - I really need to implement unit tests.)

2009-03-21
	Unary minus disambiguation (similar to UCBLogo):

	Minus sign is parsed as unary minus if it begins a top-level expression, or if it follows an infix operator, or it has a leading space and has no trailing space.
	Otherwise, minus sign is parsed as an infix difference operator.
	Compare:
	cs ht print -5 (unary; will print -5)
	cs ht print - 5 + 10 (unary; will print 5)
	cs ht print 10 + - 5 (unary; will print 5)
	cs ht print 10 -5 (unary; will print 10)
	cs ht print 10 - 5 (infix; will print 5)
	cs ht print 10-5 (infix; will print 10)
	cs ht print 10- 5 (infix; will print 5)
	cs ht print sum 10 -5 (unary; will print 5)
	cs ht print sum 10 - 5 (infix; will produce error!)

2009-01-20
	Added list, fput, lput
	Added show (temporary) which returns a string representation of its argument

2008-09-28
	Added (temporary) display of command history, at the bottom of the window
	Added def (hacky implementation) that shows the definition of a function

2008-09-02
	Added reverse, iseq
	print can now print lists
	Fixed evaluation of lists (e.g. map "square [ 50 + 50 ] now works) [UPDATE 2009-11-19: This is no longer the case]

2008-09-01
	Rearranged page to maximize display area

2008-08-31
	Added map, filter, reduce
	Added pencolor as alias for setcolor, can take r, g, b as arguments
	Blocks in repeat, if, etc. no longer introduce a scope
	Comments (anything after ; on a line) are ignored)
	Renamed predicates to equal?, notequal?, less?, lessequal?, greater?, greaterequal?
	Changed the "draw text" procedure to print
	Added output which returns a value from a procedure

2008-08-30
	Lisp-style calling syntax ( procedure input ... ) now operates per standard Logo, rather than as an implicit reduction.
	Make use of JavaScript 1.6 and 1.8 functions internally, via compatibility shims

2008-08-26
	Fixed tan
	Trig functions now take/return degrees
	KNOWN ISSUE: setxy -100 -100 parses as setxy (-100 -100) and so fails with too few arguments.
	make :var and make var are now synonyms for make "var
	Added true and false

2008-08-25
	Fixed procedures that return values
	Made setpos and friends leave a trail if the pen is down
	jslint cleanup
	Support ( proc input ... ) format
	Fixed and and or to not lazily-evaluate arguments - and 0 1 would not consume the 1
	Added support for ( procedure input ... ) expressions. Acts as reduce, so ( sum 1 2 3 4 ) calls sum 1 2 then sum 3 3 then sum 6 4, finally returning 10.

2008-08-24
	Added string/number coercion
	Added word and output
	Allow unquoted variable names in make
	Added and, or, xor and setfont
	Changed towards to return a heading, rather than set a heading
	Added infix expressions
	Added first, last, butfirst, butlast
	Added power, sqrt, arctan, sin, cos, tan, int, round
	Renamed add to sum, sub to difference, mul to product, div to quotient, mod to modulus, neg to minus

	Added pos and heading

2008-08-20

	Fixed parsing of setpos inputs
	Inverted Y axis for absolute coordinate references (positive Y is now upwards)

2008-08-19
	Can't use lt for both "left turn" and "less than". The latter is now lth
	Added make, setxy, setx, sety, setheading. Updated setpos
	Fixed negative number parsing
	Added toggle to multiline display
	Corrected repcount behavior for nested repeats

2008-08-18
	Added mathematical and logical operations

2008-08-17
	Added if, ifelse, repcount, clean, home, showturtle, hideturtle

	Had left and right switched. Oops.

2008-08-16
	Written and published
